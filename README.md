# Most Annoying Task Manager

### Background:
This was for a server-side Python3/Django course at the University
of Wisconsin - Milwaukee. The goal was to create a web app that 
would email and text users every `x` minutes past due the task was. 
The goal was to have users configure the minutes (from 1 - 100) in their profile
settings page and then use SendGrid to email and perhaps Twillio to send texts.
However, there are many changes that need to be make before that is realistic.

### Requirements:
* Download everything in the `requirements.txt` file
* Python 3

### Running
* Once a Django project is configured in an IDE, such as Pycharm, then running using 
the "Run" icon can be used, then navigate to "localhost:8000"
